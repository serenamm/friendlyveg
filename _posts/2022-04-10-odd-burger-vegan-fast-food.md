Vegan fast food from <a href='https://oddburger.com/'>Odd Burger</a>! Odd Burger is often referred to colloquially as "Vegan McDonalds", but I'd say it's **better** in quality, and yes, it's **100% vegan**.

I first came across Odd Burger when they were known as **Globally Local**. I was (and still am) lucky enough to live a 20 minute walk from their location on College Street in Toronto. My partner and I used to go occasionally after our workouts at our gym, which was conveniently across the street!

Founded in 2014, Odd Burger is Canada's **first vegan fast food chain**, and is the first vegan fast food chain to go **public** under the ticker **TSXV:ODD**. Very exciting stuff! THey are located in Ontario with plans to expand across Canada and internationally.
