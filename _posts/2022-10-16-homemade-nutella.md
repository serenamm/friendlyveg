Here's a ridiculously easy recipe for homemade "nutella". It's only 2 ingredients and is so fast to make!

All you have to do is pour some tahini on top of chocolate chips, and melt it in the microwave.

Of course, you could use hazelnut butter instead of tahini, but hazelnut butter is a bit pricey.

Using tahini will allow you to get that nutty, chocolately flavour of nutella, at a fraction of the price!

No food processor required, either!
