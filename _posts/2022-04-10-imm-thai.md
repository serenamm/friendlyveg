If you're looking for **authentic Thai food** at a **reasonable price point**, Imm Thai may be for you. But if you're going to order a vegan item off the menu, be careful.

I first came across Imm Thai when I moved to Toronto. I was chatting with a colleague at work and mentioned the area I lived in, and he was like, "Oh, you gotta try Imm Thai. It's great."

Since then, I would say I'm a regular at Imm Thai, for my standards (I don't order food much). For a period during the pandemic my partner and I used to order from Imm nearly **once a month**!

While the food is delicious (I recommend the **green curry** and **fried peanut butter tofu**), it's been hit or miss for us when we've ordered -- there has been more than one occasion where we asked for the vegan version of a dish and have been given something that clearly is non-vegan.

Now, mistakes happen! It's part of life. It's unfortunate that it's happened more than once to my partner and I. In order to mitigate this, we often order the **vegan combo for two**. We've only had non-vegan/vegan mix ups whenever we've ordered online, and deviated from the vegan combo. I guess that's what we get for being difficult :) But sometimes it's fine!

In summary, Imm's food is absolutely delicious. They're a local business, so please do go support them. But as a word of caution, if you're vegan, you may want to **order over the phone** or **stick with the vegan combo**.
