  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 1/2 package firm tofu
    * 1 tbsp of miso paste
    * 2 tbsp of vegan margarine (butter works too!)
    * 1 tbsp soya sauce
    * 1 tbsp cooking oil (I use canola oil)
  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Cut the tofu into pieces that are about 3/4 of an inch thick (cubes, squares, or whatever you like!).
    2. Mix together miso, vegan margarine, and soya sauce.
    3. Coat each piece of tofu with the sauce, making sure to coat both sides.
    4. Place a tablespoon of oil in a pan or wok.
    5. Fry the coated tofu, for about 5 minutes on each side. The marinade and tofu should lose some water, and look a bit crispy.
    5. Plate, and enjoy!

Do you wanna eat more tofu, but you're **not sure how**? Are you wondering *how can I make tofu taste good*, or are you looking for *easy ways to prepare tofu*? If so, this tofu recipe is for you!

And it **kind of tastes like (vegan) salmon** :)

This is one of my favourite meals to make **for my mom**, who is at the same time my *biggest fan and my biggest critic*. If she likes it, then I think **you will too** !

This recipe is **super versatile** - you can use soft tofu, medium firm tofu, firm (like I did here) or extra firm. Just note that if using soft tofu, you'll need to be **extra gentle**. But I find the **softer** the tofu, the more it **tastes like salmon**.

You can even **bake** the tofu if you'd like. In that case, I'd suggest baking it at *400 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 - 45 minutes* to make it nice and crispy.

If you're not a fan of soya sauce, you can feel fee to omit it, or use any sort of salt you'd like. Personally, I find that the soya sauce combined with butter and miso come together to create that **perfect umami taste**.
