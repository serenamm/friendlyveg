I posted a "what I ate as a vegan" video on TikTok the other day featuring this recipe. I didn't realize that so many people would be interested in the recipe! :) Here it is!

My partner threw this together the other night, and I didn't even think to have him film or write down what he did. Fortunately he has a pretty good memory and was able to share the details with me!
