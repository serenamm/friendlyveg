This **immunity boosting** carrot apple beet juice is *so easy* to make - it only takes **15 minutes** to throw everything together! Plus, the addition of ginger adds a nice kick and immune boost.

To add **even more immune boosting properties** to this juice, try adding in half a teaspoon of tumeric and black pepper!

And really, why buy carrot apple beet juice when you can make it at home for **half the price**? 

Note that this recipe requires either a blender or a juicer :)

This [Hamilton Beach blender](https://amzn.to/3LQHLsV) is a good first blender if you're looking for one (affiliate link!).

I can't recall when I first developed my love for beet juice, but it's always a juice I really enjoy. However, I can rarely bring myself to pay for it when I know I could make it at home myself.

It's super important to cut the beets and carrots up into small pieces. These vegetables are **hard**. If they're too large, your blender will struggle and you might have to pour everything out, fish the carrots and beets out of the half-blended juicy mess, and chop them up a second time (*speaking from experience!*). So my suggestion is to take the few extra minutes required to make sure your veggies are cut small!
