One bite into this **vegan pound cake** and you might find yourself asking: *wow, this is vegan?*

## This pound cake tastes so egg-y, and is 100% vegan!

This pound cake calls for only *5 ingredients*, comes together in a few easy steps, and will satisfy any pound cake fanatic you know.

Trust me - my mom is HUGE into pound cake. My mom used to bake pound cake all the time but *stopped when I went vegan*. She absolutely **devoured this vegan version**.

This pound cake is a veganized version of [Martha Stewart's pound cake](https://www.marthastewart.com/337155/vanilla-pound-cake), with Just Egg instead of a chicken egg. **And it works SO well**!

This pound cake recipe originally calls for **4 eggs** which is **equivalent to 1 cup Just Egg**. For more details, you can refer to my post on [how to bake with Just Egg]({{ '/vegan%20baking/2022/03/19/baking-just-egg/' | relative_url }}).

Pound cake is a type of cake traditionally made with **a pound of each** of four ingredients: flour, butter, eggs, and sugar. Naturally, this is *not vegan friendly*. Fortunately we now have access to SO many vegan products. I used **Becel's vegan margarine** to substitute the butter and **Just Egg** to substitute the egg.

One thing to note is that **white sugar isn't vegan everywhere**. Bone char is often used to filter white sugar in certain regions - if this is a concern in your area, I recommend you buy **organic sugar** which does not use bone char in the filtration process.
