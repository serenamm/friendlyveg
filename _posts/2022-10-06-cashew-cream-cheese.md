This cashew cream cheese will be your breakfast for a week, and only costs $2.74!

All you have to do is: add 2 cups of cashew, 2 tbsp of lemon juice, 1 tsp of salt, and 1/4 cup of water to a blender.

Blend it up, and stop to scrape and add more water. You'll likely want to add about another 1/4 of a cup.

Eventually you'll get a nice creamy consistency. At this point you can add some herbs, and blend it up a final time with the herbs in the cream cheese. I used basil from my garden!

Finally, scrape it into a container and enjoy it :)

This costs less than half the price of what you would buy at the store, and it's just as delicious!
