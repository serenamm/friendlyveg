**Moist**, **addicting**, and **"wow, this is vegan?"** are ways this pumpkin loaf has been described. It's one of my favourite desserts to serve to friends because I love their reactions - they always want **more, more, more** !

This super simple and delicious **one bowl** pumpkin loaf recipe has been with me for **ten years**. Can you believe it? Ten years ago I would make pumpkin loaf for my university friends for potlucks. Ten years later I'm still making it for those same friends :)

What I love about this loaf recipe is how versatile it is. You can use pumpkin, you can use banana, or you could use any other fruit puree you like. All that matters is that the ratios of fruit puree to sugar to flour and to leavening agent stay the same (maybe that sounds like a lot? :D )

PHOTO

Speaking of leavening agents, you may notice that there's both **baking powder and baking soda** in this recipe. It might seem like a lot if you're not used to vegan baking. In this case, we add both of these leavening agents to make up for the fact that there are no eggs in this recipe. Eggs act as a leavening agent in loaves with ingredient ratios such as this, so we need to replace its function.

If you enjoy a different flavour profile, feel free to use different spices. You can easily put your own twist on this recipe, and make it your own!
