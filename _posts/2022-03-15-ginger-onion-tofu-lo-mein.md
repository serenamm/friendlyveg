You can do it two way.  1) Cut firm tofu into med size and brown both side with a little bit oil. 2) Put it backs the plate. 3) Cut ginger and green onion into small long thin slices. 4) put one two table spoonful of oil into the wok and wait till it really oil, pot onto the tofu surface. 5) add soya sauce on top and serve. Sometimes I like to add a little bit sesame oil on it to taste too. The heated oil depends on how much tofu you have. I find you need a little bit more oil to go with vegetarian meal, otherwise it’s hard to build muscle by just eating the plant protein. I don’t know maybe I haven’t eaten enough protein.

Another method is to cut the SOFT tofu in small pieces and steam it on the plate for 7- 8 min, then treat it with the sand oil , ginger & green onion and soya sauce on top after. It tastes good too

You can also cut the tofu into small cube, brown it. Cook some Noodles, drain it and put the tofu cube on top. Then use the same oil , ginger & green onion and sauce from above method to do a Lo Min 撈麵
