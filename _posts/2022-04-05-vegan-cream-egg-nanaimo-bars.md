    **The base**
    * 1/2 cup vegan butter, softened
    * 1/4 cup white sugar
    * 5 tablespoons cocoa powder
    * 1 tbsp vegetable oil (I use canola)
    * 1 tbsp ground flax seed
    * 1 1/2 cup saltine crackers, crumbled (about 30 crackers)
    * 1 cup shredded coconut

    **Cream layer**
    * 1/2 cup light corn syrup
    * 1/4 cup vegan butter
    * 1 tsp vanilla
    * 1/8 tsp salt
    * 3 cups icing sugar
    * 1 tbsp vegan cream (I use Silk's soy creamer)
    * Optional: yellow food colouring

    **Top layer**
    * 3/4 cup chocolate chips
    * 3 tablespoons vegan butter

    **First, make the base**
    1. Crumble the soda crackers into a medium bowl. The larger the crumbs, the crunchier the Nanaimo bar!
    2. In the top of a double boiler, combine a 1/2 cup of vegan butter, white sugar, and cocoa powder. Stir until melted and smooth.
    3. Remove the butter mixture from heat and add in the flax seed and oil. Mix well.
    4. Mix in the crumbled saltine crackers and shredded coconut.
    5. Press into the bottom of a loaf pan if you enjoy thick bars, or an 8x8 pan if you thinner bars.
    6. Put in the freezer to chill, while you make the cream layer.

    **Next, make the cream layer**
    1. Mix together the corn syrup, vegan butter, vanilla, and salt until smooth, either by hand or with a hand mixer.
    2. Mix in the icing sugar bit by bit, until the mixture is smooth and creamy.
    3. (Optional) add a few drops of yellow food colouring to make the mixture look more egg-like.

    **Finally, we make the chocolate layer**
    1. Melt together the chocolate chips and vegan butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for about 45 seconds at a time, stirring in between. Microwave until the mixture is soft and silky. This should take about 2 minutes.

    **Assemble the bars**
    1. Once the base and cream layer have chilled and set, spread the melted chocolate over the bars. 
    2. Let the bars chill once again in the fridge or freezer. This should take about 15 minutes.
    3. Cut into the bars, and enjoy!

## What's with the cream egg filling?

The only thing that makes this recipe different from my [Nanaimo Crunch Bars]({{ '/vegan%20baking/2022/04/03/vegan-soda-cracker-nanaimo-bars/' | relative_url }}) is that I use a vegan cream egg filling.

The cream egg is **incredibly easy**. All you do is blend up the corn syrup, vegan butter, vanilla, salt icing sugar, and creamer. That's it! The base and top layer, as well as the assembly, is all the same as the original recipe.
