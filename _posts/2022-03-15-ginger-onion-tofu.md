From Daai Yi Maa:

You can do it two way.  1) Cut firm tofu into med size and brown both side with a little bit oil. 2) Put it backs the plate. 3) Cut ginger and green onion into small long thin slices. 4) put one two table spoonful of oil into the wok and wait till it really oil, pot onto the tofu surface. 5) add soya sauce on top and serve. Sometimes I like to add a little bit sesame oil on it to taste too. The heated oil depends on how much tofu you have. I find you need a little bit more oil to go with vegetarian meal, otherwise it’s hard to build muscle by just eating the plant protein. I don’t know maybe I haven’t eaten enough protein.
