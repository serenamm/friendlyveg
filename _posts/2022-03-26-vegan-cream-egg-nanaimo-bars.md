    **The base**
    * 1/2 cup vegan butter, softened
    * 1/4 cup white sugar
    * 5 tablespoons cocoa powder
    * 1 tbsp vegetable oil (I use canola)
    * 1 tbsp ground flax seed
    * 1 1/2 cup saltine crackers, crumbled (about 30 crackers)
    * 1 cup shredded coconut

    **Cream layer**
    * 1/2 cup light corn syrup
    * 1/4 cup vegan butter
    * 1 tsp vanilla
    * 1/8 tsp salt
    * 3 cups icing sugar

    **Top layer**
    * 3/4 cup chocolate chips
    * 3 tablespoons vegan butter

    **First, make the base**
    1. Crumble the soda crackers into a medium bowl. The larger the crumbs, the crunchier the Nanaimo bar!
    2. In the top of a double boiler, combine a 1/2 cup of vegan butter, white sugar, and cocoa powder. Stir until melted and smooth.
    3. Remove the butter mixture from heat and add in the flax seed and oil. Mix well.
    4. Mix in the crumbled saltine crackers and shredded coconut.
    5. Press into the bottom of a loaf pan if you enjoy thick bars, or an 8x8 pan if you thinner bars.
    6. Put in the freezer to chill, while you make the cream layer.

    **Next, make the cream layer**
    1. Mix together the corn syrup, vegan butter, vanilla, and salt until smooth, either by hand or with a hand mixer.
    2. Mix in the icing sugar bit by bit, until the mixture is smooth and creamy.
    3. (Optional) add a few drops of yellow food colouring to make the mixture look more egg-like.

    **Finally, we make the chocolate layer**
    1. Melt together the chocolate chips and vegan butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for about 45 seconds at a time, stirring in between. Microwave until the mixture is soft and silky. This should take about 2 minutes.

    **Assemble the bars**
    1. Once the base and cream layer have chilled and set, spread the melted chocolate over the bars. 
    2. Let the bars chill once again in the fridge or freezer. This should take about 15 minutes.
    3. Cut into the bars, and enjoy!

## These cream egg Nanaimo bars are a fun Easter twist on the classic no-bakke dessert.

*Oh my gosh, I can't stop eating these"- my Mom*.

**Vegan cream egg and Nanaimo bar all in one** - you read that right!

### So, what is a Nanaimo bar?

As mentioned in my Nanaimo bar post (TO DO: LINK), the Nanaimo bar is a no-bake dessert that is named after the city of Nanaimo in British Columbia, Canada. Growing up in Vancouver, I thought everyone knew about Nanaimo bars. It wasn't until I moved out of the province that I learned that these delicious chocolate-y bars are unique to this part of the country!

Nanaimo bars typically consist of 3 layers: a wafer, nut, and coconut crumb base; custard icing in the middle; and a layer of chocolate ganache on top.

In this case, we'll use a vegan cream egg filling for the  middle layer!

### What's with the saltine crackers?

The saltine crackers are what gives this bar the **crunch**. I use saltine crackers in my Crunchy Nanaimo Bars too :) (LINK)

For the top chocolate layer, it's **ridiculously easy**: microwave together *chocolate chips and vegan butter* until smooth and silky. That's it!

Spread the chocolatey mixture on top of the chilled bars, and let the bars cool for another 15 minutes. And that's it! You've made Nanaimo bars!
