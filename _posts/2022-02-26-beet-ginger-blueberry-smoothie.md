recipe:
  servings: one large smoothie
  prep: 10 minutes
  cook: 0
  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 1/4 of a beet
    * 2 bananas (I prefer frozen)
    * 1/3 cup frozen or fresh blueberries (I use frozen)
    * 1 thumb of ginger
    * 2 cups of liquid (almond milk if you want it creamy, or water if you'd prefer)
    * 2 tbsp peanut butter (optional)
  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Wash about a thumb sized amount of ginger, as well as a beet.
    1. Cut off a quarter of the beet. Put the remainder in the fridge - you only need a quarter for this smoothie!
    2. Peel the beet, and ginger.
    3. Cut the quarter of the beet into pieces - or if you dare, don't cut it up at all. Your blender might be able to handle it! 
    4. Place (or throw!) into your blender: beet, ginger, and your liquid of choice. If you're using fresh blueberries or bananas, then throw them in the blender too.
    5. Blend!
    6. Place (or throw again, but beware of the splash) into your blender: frozen blueberries and frozen banana, if you're using it.
    7. Blend, and enjoy!

This blueberry ginger beet smoothie is incredible - it tastes great, and it **boosts your immune system**. You won't even realize it has beets in it!

Note that this recipe requires a blender :) This [Hamilton Beach blender](https://amzn.to/3LQHLsV) is a good first blender if you're looking for one (affiliate link!). I often use a [Blendtec](https://www.amazon.com/Blendtec-Original-Professional-Grade-Pre-programmed-10-speeds/dp/B000GIGZXM/?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=friendlyvegbl-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=6baf907d879fe4c3a4b5aaa17da728c0&camp=1789&creative=9325).

I first developed a love of smoothies when I was in high school. My ideal outing with friends involved shopping at the mall, and finishing up our day with a smoothie from Orange Julius. My go to smoothie order was pretty basic: strawberry banana. It wasn't until several years later that I discovered the joys of adding vegetables into your smoothies.

When adding vegetables into your smoothies, it's **important to blend them up first** before adding any frozen fruit. The goal is to liquify the veggies - otherwise you might find your smoothie tastes grainy, which can be unpleasant. So blend the most fibrous products (the beet and ginger) in with the softest (the liquid and fresh fruit) to ensure a **smoother consistency**.

Once you have successfully liquified the beet and ginger, go ahead and throw in any frozen fruit you're using. **Pro tip**: use more frozen fruit for a creamier smoothie.
