recipe:
  servings: 3 servings as a main meal, or 4 servings as a side or snack
  prep: 45 minutes
  cook: 50 minutes
  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 1/4 of a beet
    * 2 bananas (I prefer frozen)
    * 1/3 cup frozen or fresh blueberries (I use frozen)
    * 1 thumb of ginger
    * 2 cups of liquid (almond milk if you want it creamy, or water if you'd prefer)
    * 2 tbsp peanut butter (optional)
  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Peel a beet.
    2. Cut it into quarters. Put 3/4 of in the fridge - you only need a quarter for this smoothie!
    3. Cut the quarter of the beet into pieces - or if you dare, don't cut it up at all. Your blender might be able to handle it??
    4. Place (or throw) into your blender: beet, ginger, your liquid, and any fresh fruit you're using.
    5. Blend!
    6. Place (or throw, but beware of the splash) into your blender: any frozen fruit.
    7. Blend, and enjoy!

Really important to trust the process with the sauce. Ketchup throws off a lot of people.
