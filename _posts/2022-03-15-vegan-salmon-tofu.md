    1. Cut the tofu into pieces that are about 3/4 of an inch thick (cubes, squares, or whatever you like!).
    2. Shred the nori into small pieces. You can do this with your hands or you can cut it with a knife.
    3. Make the sauce: mix together mayonnaise, soya sauce, and nori.
    3. Coat each piece of tofu with the sauce, making sure to coat both sides.
    4. Place a tablespoon of oil in a pan or wok.
    5. Fry the coated tofu, for about 5 minutes on each side. The marinade and tofu should lose some water, and look a bit crispy.
    5. Plate, and enjoy!
