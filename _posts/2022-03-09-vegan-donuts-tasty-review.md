If you've never made donuts before (vegan or non-vegan ones) then I highly recommend you try out Tasty's <a href='https://tasty.co/recipe/vegan-doughnuts'>vegan donut recipe</a>! These donuts came out **surprisingly well**, given that I'm an absolute beginner of a donut maker.

I remember when Tim Horton's first came to Vancouver when I was a child. I was in love with their chocolate glaze donut! However my love for Tim Horton's donuts was short lived, as they sadly do not offer any **vegan options**.

It wasn't until I moved to Toronto in 2018 that I re-discovered donuts. I do love them, but I'd never thought to make them.

I was surprised to learn how easy it is to make donuts at home! This recipe requires ingredients that you most likely have at home - this recipe doesn't even require yeast! Although I did find these to be **a bit dense**. I wonder if adding yeast would make them lighter?

I also had to **add a bit more liquid** than the recipe calls for, as the dough was too dry to form into a donut shape. In the future I'd like to see how I can make these come out smoother - they definitely tasted good, but were a bit uneven on the outside as you can see from the pictures.

Overall, these are great donuts for a beginner like myself!
