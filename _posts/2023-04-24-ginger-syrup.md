This concentrated ginger syrup is **perfect** for ginger tea!

I love ginger. Whenever I had a stomach ache growing up, my mom would make 薑茶 (geong cha) aka a ginger tea! It always soothed my stomach and helped out my digestion. I find ginger tea to be very calming - it's my tea of choice!

This ginger syrup is a great **time saver** - when I make ginger tea I usually slice up some ginger and let it seep in hot water for 15 minutes.

Making ginger tea is so much faster with this syrup - I can put the syrup in some hot water and drink my tea immediately!

If you were to drink a ginger tea everyday, that would mean you save an hour and 45 minutes each week :) That's a lot of time!

I call this a ginger *syrup* but really you could think about it like a ginger *concentrate*. *Syrup* is a more exciting name, though. :)

You could add sugar to this syrup and pour it over dessert tofu or ice cream, or put it in smoothies!
