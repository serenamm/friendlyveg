I visited Nashville the other week and kept being told that I *needed* to try some Nashville hot chicken. But the problem is... I'm vegan! Fortunately, Vege-licious Cafe exists!

Vege-licious is a hole in the wall kind of place - and it love that! When I walked in I was (awkwardly) filming and was greeted by the staff (very pleasantly) with a "welcome!" which was very unexpected.
