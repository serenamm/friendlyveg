    1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.
    2. Line a baking tin with parchment paper, or wipe it with an oiled paper towel. Set aside.
    3. If making your own oat flour: pour rolled oats into a blender or food processor. Blend until it's a flour-y, dusty consistency. Set aside.
    4. Mix the wet ingredients in a large bowl.
    5. Add the dry ingredients in any order, including the oat flour you may have made earlier. Mix everything until just combined. Try not to over mix!
    6. Pour the batter in the lined/oiled baking tin.
    7. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 - 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the loaf comes out clean.

**"I like this better than the gluten version!"**, **"Wow, this is vegan? And it's gluten free?"**, are ways my friends have described this loaf.

PHOTO

This pumpkin loaf recipe has been with me for **ten years**, but it's only in the past few years that I've tried making it **gluten-free**. And to my surprise, the original gluten-filled version has translated perfectly into a gluten-free counterpart!

I love how versatile this loaf recipe is. You can use any fruit puree you like (so you're not stuck with pumpkin), and you can use melted vegan butter if you want instead of oil. All that matters is that the ratios of fruit puree to sugar to flour and to leavening agent stay the same (maybe that sounds like a lot? :D )

PHOTO

Speaking of leavening agents, you may notice that there's both **baking powder and baking soda** in this recipe. It might seem like a lot if you're not used to vegan baking. In this case, we add both of these leavening agents to make up for the fact that there are no eggs in this recipe. Eggs act as a leavening agent in loaves with ingredient ratios such as this, so we need to replace its function.

If you enjoy a different flavour profile, feel free to use different spices. You can easily put your own twist on this recipe, and make it your own!

Some variations of this recipe that I enjoy:
<ul>
<li>Adding chocolate chips</li>
<li>Making the original recipe, which does contain gluten (link) </li>
<li>Using banana instead of pumpkin</li>
