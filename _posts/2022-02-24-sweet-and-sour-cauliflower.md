  ingredients_markdown: |-
    **Cauliflower Wings**
    * 1 head of cauliflower (any size is fine!)
    * 3/4 cup water
    * 1/2 cup non-dariy milk (or sub for more water if you'd like)
    * 1 cup flour
    * 1 tsp five spice (can sub for cumin)
    * 1 tsp paprika
    * 2 tsp onion powder
    * 1/2 tsp salt
    * 1/2 tsp black pepper

    **Sweet and Sour Sauce**
    * 3/4 cup ketchup (trust me on this!)
    * 3/4 cup white sugar
    * 3 tsp lemon juice
    * 1 tsp salt
    * 1/2 cup hot water
  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Pre-heat your oven to 450 degrees F, and line baking sheets with parchment paper.
    2. Wash cauliflower, and cut it into bite sized pieces.
    3. Mix all the Cauliflower ingredients in a bowl: the flour, water, non-dairy milk if using, five spice, paprika, onion powder, salt, and black pepper. The batter should be thick.
    4. Dip each cauliflower piece in the batter individually, and tap off the excess. Or, dump all the cauliflower into the batter and mix to evenly coat them all.
    5. Lay the battered cauliflower on the baking sheets.
    6. Bake for 25 minutes, flipping halfway through (so bake for ~ 12 minutes, flip, then bake for another ~12 minutes).
    7. While the cauliflower is baking, make the sweet and sour sauce. Simply combine all the ingredients (ketchup, white sugar, lemon juice, salt, and hot water) in a bowl, and mix.
    8. Once the cauliflower is done its first bake, take them out of the oven and coat them all in the sweet and sour sauce. Like with the batter, you can coat each piece one by one, or dump everything in the sweet and sour bowl and mix to coat evenly.
    9. Time for the second bake: bake the coated and battered cauliflower for 25 minutes. As before, flip halfway through.
    10. Enjoy!

Really important to trust the process with the sauce. Ketchup throws off a lot of people.
