    1. Place ingredients in your bread maker.
    2. Turn the break maker on and use the "dough" setting. Walk away, and let your bread maker do its thing!
    3. When the dough is ready, take it out place it in a lightly covered bowl.
    4. Punch the dough down.
    5. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and a clean kitchen towel. Let sit for about 2 hours until it's doubled in size.
    6. Before rolling the dough out, grease a baking sheet or pizza pan with oil, and sprinkle corn meal on top. This will give it a nice crispy bottom and a delicious texture.
    7. Roll the dough out into the desired size.
    8. Top with your favourite toppings and bake for 15 - 20 minutes until slightly brown.
