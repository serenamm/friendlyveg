If you're like me, then you've searched all over the internet for that **perfect pizza dough** recipe. I think I've finally developed on that hits the mark! 

This pizza dough is the **easiest** and **tastiest** pizza dough I've had.

I used to love going to <a href='https://www.pizzaexpress.com/'>PizzaExpress</a> when I lived in Hong Kong. My favourite pizza to order was the Giardiniera without cheese. Since moving back to Canada, I haven't yet been able to find a pizza place quite like it.

Even if PizzaExpress-level pizza existed near me in Canada, I would still want to make my own pizza at home - it's fun to go out to eat, but cooking at home is very comforting to me, and it also **saves money**.

There is one **key point** to this pizza dough recipe: using **corn meal**! Corn meal gives this dough a **delicious crunch and texture**. It also provides space between the pan and the dough itself to let even more heat in to the bottom of the dough. This makes the pizza crust come out nice and crispy!

I love that I can use my **bread machine** for this recipe - it's such a **time saver**! However, if you'd like to knead it yourself, you can knead it for about **ten minutes**. If the dough feels too sticky, feel free to add a few tablespoons of flour.s

In summary, there are **eight simple steps** to this incredible pizza dough:

<ul>
<li>1. Mix together.</li>
<li>2. Knead.</li>
<li>3. Rise.</li>
<li>4. Optional: Punch and rise again.</li>
<li>5. Oil a pizza pan / baking sheet, and sprinkle on corn meal.</li>
<li>6. Roll out the dough.</li>
<li>7. Add your toppings.</li>
<li>8. Bake.</li>
</ul>

And that's it!
