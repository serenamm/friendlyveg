This **restaurant style** sweet and sour sauce is truly the **easiest** sauce to make. You might not believe how easy it is! :) 

This sauce is perfect on top of stir fried veggies, vegan chicken, or just as a sauce over rice!

This one of the sauces I grew up eating, whether it was out at a Chinese restaurant or at my Gung Gung and Po Po's house. In fact, this is the recipe that my Po Po (my maternal grandma) uses!

# Wait, ketchup!?

The use of ketchup in this recipe might seem strange, but trust me on this!

If the sauce is too watery, try adding more corn starch or letting it boil for longer (or both!). Eventually it'll become the consistency you like.
