recipe:
  servings: 2-3 servings
  prep: 5 minutes
  cook: 10 minutes
  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 1/2 package firm tofu
    * 3 tablespoons of vegan mayonnaise
    * 1 tbsp soya sauce
    * 1 nori sheet
    * 1 tbsp cooking oil (I use canola oil)
  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Cut the tofu into pieces that are about 3/4 of an inch thick (cubes, squares, or whatever you like!).
    2. Shred the nori into small pieces. You can do this with your hands or you can cut it with a knife.
    3. Make the sauce: mix together mayonnaise, soya sauce, and nori.
    3. Coat each piece of tofu with the sauce, making sure to coat both sides.
    4. Place a tablespoon of oil in a pan or wok.
    5. Fry the coated tofu, for about 5 minutes on each side. The marinade and tofu should lose some water, and look a bit crispy.
    5. Plate, and enjoy!

Have you ever wondered: *how can I make vegan salmon from tofu*?, *how can I make tofu taste like salmon*?, or *can I make tofu taste like fish*? Yes, you can, if you use the **same seasonings** you would use on your fish.

## This soya mayo "salmon" is an incredibly easy and satisfying way to prepare tofu!

This reminds me of my **childhood favourite dish**. Coated with **umami** flavour and pan fried to perfection (whatever your definition of "perfect" is :) ) this **vegan "salmon" tofu** is sure a hit in my household!

It only take **15 minutes** to throw this all together with only **5** (yes, five!) ingredients. Give it a try!

### I used to love soya mayo salmon when I was in high school.

I even declared to my mom that when I went to university I would eat soya mayo salmon **every single day**!

Oh, I was naive back then (weren't we all, and aren't we all still!?). I haven't had salmon in over a decade, and sometimes I miss my old favourite dish!

While it is very difficult to replicate salmon, this **soya mayo tofu** satisfies my craving!

The key to this dish is the mixture of mayonnaise and soya sauce. The *fattiness and tang from the mayo* and the salt from the soya sauce combine together to make this tofu dish have a lovely **savoury, umami** taste.

### The nori is a bonus, and adds a nice fishy flavour.

You could omit it if you want.

If you want to be really *aesthetic*, you could **wrap the marinaded tofu in nori** rather than shredding it as I did.

I'm a bit lazy and like cooking quickly :)

## Make it gluten free! 

If soya sauce isn't for you, feel free to use **tamari**. **Coconut aminos** would work too to make this *gluten free*.
