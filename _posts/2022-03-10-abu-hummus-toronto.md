You know when you eat a meal, and you feel **so happy in your belly**? That's how eating at Abu Hummus made me feel. If you're looking for a quick meal in **Kensington Market** either for yourself or a group of vegans and non-vegans, you might want to check out **Abu Hummus**!

I had no idea about Abu Hummus until I met Avra Epstein who was kind enough to give me a code for two free combo meals at the restaurant. (By the way, Avra has an awesome [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/avraepstein/), [blog](http://www.lovewildlivefree.com/), and [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@avraepstein?lang=en)).

What I love about a place like Abu Hummus is that it has options for vegans and non-vegans. You see, the **most difficult part about being vegan** for me is the social isolation. Most of my friends aren't vegan. But I still want to eat with them!

So I went to Abu with a friend who happens to be a vegetarian. We got the vegan shwarama plate with a side of mushrooms, and the falafel plate with a side of roasted garlic tomato dip.

The hummus was so good - **light, creamy, smooth**, absolutely everything you would want in a hummus. And the falafel was so **green**, it was incredible. And the mushrooms tasted like stewed Chinese mushrooms that I grew up eating! I could go on :)

Overall I would recommend Abu Hummus. It's a great spot, and I look forward to my next visit!
